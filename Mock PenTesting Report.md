### High-Level Summary

GoodSecurity was tasked with performing an internal penetration test on GoodCorp’s CEO, Hans Gruber. An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack against internally connected systems. The goal of this test is to perform attacks similar to those of a hacker and attempt to infiltrate Hans’ computer to determine if it is at risk. GoodSecurity’s overall objective was to exploit any vulnerable software, find a secret recipe file on Hans’ computer, and report the findings back to GoodCorp.

The internal penetration test found several alarming vulnerabilities on Hans’ computer: When performing the attacks, GoodSecurity was able to gain access to his machine and find the secret recipe file by exploiting two programs with major vulnerabilities. The details of the attack are below.

### Findings

Machine IP:
- 192.168.0.20

Hostname:
- MSEDGEWIN10
 
Vulnerability Exploited:
- exploit/windows/http/icecast_header

Vulnerability Explanation:
- The vulnerability is a Buffer Overflow exploit, meaning that it puts more data in a buffer than it is capable of holding. This one specifically sends enough header to write one past the end of a pointer array. For the windows system we are targeting this overwrites the saved instruction pointer. This all allows us to run code with the privilege of the icecast server process.

Severity:
- This vulnerability is severe, as it gives the attacker access to files on the computer potentially containing sensitive data. Rated a 7.5

Utilizing meterpreter’s search function to locate sensitive data.




### Recommendations

Icecast offers a patch for the vulnerability that should be installed on all systems. In the future ensuring that your firewalls are updated to only allow ports that are necessary for day to day operations, keeping up to date with your software publishers will likely allow you to stay ahead of surprise attacks, and installing antivirus software to monitor suspicious activity on your device are all good preventative measures to take.
